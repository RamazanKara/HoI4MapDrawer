This tool takes an HoI4 save and creates a world map from it.

To run it, you will need the .Net framework installed.

To use it, run it, set the directory to your HoI4 install, and select a save. Then press begin. A map will be saved in the same directory as the tool.

The latest version can be found on the paradox forums at:
