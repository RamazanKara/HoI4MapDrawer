Q: I got the error "Save is binary. See FAQ for solution". What's the solution?
A:
	1. Go to your HoI4 documents directory (C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV).
	2. Open settings.txt.
	3. Find the line "save_as_binary=yes" and change the yes to no.
	4. Save the file and close it.
	5. Launch HoI4, load your save, and save again.
	6. This new save can be used by the tool.
